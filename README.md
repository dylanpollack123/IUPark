# IUPark
Our team created and designed a unique interactive protoype parking app called IUPark. The app is intended to help assist students, faculty, and staff of Indiana University Bloomington with parking options on campus. The interactive prototype was created using InVision and allowed us to demonstarte our design and presentation/public speaking skills in a cohesive way.
